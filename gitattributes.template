# Codex Review Loop — hide tool files from PR diffs
#
# These files must be committed to work, but they're tooling — not the code
# being reviewed. linguist-generated collapses them by default in GitHub
# PR diffs so reviewers can focus on actual changes.
#
# Reviewers can still expand them in the diff if needed.
